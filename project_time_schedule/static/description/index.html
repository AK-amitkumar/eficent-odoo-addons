<h2 class="oe_slogan">Define the activities of the project</h2>
<p class="oe_mt32">
 The user accesses from Project - Project â€“ Tasks to the list of tasks and milestones. A new tab "Scheduling" appears.  This tab displays attributes relating to the task scheduling.
</p>        
<h2 class="oe_slogan">Define the sequence of activities</h2>
<p class="oe_mt32">
 The user creates new activities - tasks and milestones, and links them together.
</p>      
<h2 class="oe_slogan">Initiate the scheduling</h2>
<p class="oe_mt32">
 Once the user presses on the "Calculate network", the network diagram is first determined, based on the relationships between activities.
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
Starting from the first activity identified, the network goes forward first to determine the early dates of tasks, taking into account the task durations, limitations imposed start date of tasks or actual start date .
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
Starting from the last activity identified, the network is executed backwards to determine the late date, taking into account the task durations, limitations to date of completion of the work or the actual end dates.
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
For those tasks that are in the critical path of the network indicator is marked "Is in the Critical Path
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
The Total Margin (Total float) and Free margin (Free Float) is determined.
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
The method used is the Critical Chain Method (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Critical_Path_Method). 
</p>
<p class="oe_mt32">
 The critical path is calculated using the Dijkstra algorithm
